# Master in Data Analytics - Ignacio Reyes Vázquez

Welcome to the repository of my **Master in Data Analytics**! This repository contains all the code and projects I completed during the course, which include exercises, group data projects, and my final master's thesis (TFM). Below you will find a breakdown of the contents and their organization.

## 📂 Directory Structure

- **📚 Exercises**: This folder contains the individual exercises I completed during the master’s program, categorized by the technology used. Each folder represents a different technology or method that was taught, with examples and implementations of the concepts learned.

- **👩‍💻 Data Projects**: This folder includes the four group projects where we were tasked with solving real-world problems. Each project represents an **end-to-end solution** using various data analytics and machine learning techniques. The challenges ranged from data wrangling and exploration to predictive modeling and visualization.

- **📑 TFM (Final Master Thesis)**: This folder contains the code and documentation for my **Final Master's Thesis (TFM)**. It is an in-depth project where I applied everything I learned throughout the program to develop a comprehensive solution to a complex data problem.

## 🔧 Technologies and Tools Used

The projects involve a wide range of technologies, including:

- **Python** 🐍
- **Neural Networks** 📊
- **SQL** 🗃️
- **Machine Learning** 🤖
- **Data Visualization** 📈
- **Cloud Platforms** 🌐
- **Big Data Tools** 📡

## 🧑🏽‍💻 Exercises

In this section, you'll find exercises grouped by technology. Each subfolder corresponds to a specific set of challenges and lessons that I completed, such as:

**Python**, **Bash**, **Cloud**, **Notebooks**, **Machine Learning**, **Docker**, **Flask**, **Kafka**, **Spark** **&** **SQL**

## 🤝 Data Projects

In this folder, you’ll find the group projects that were focused on solving real-world problems with end-to-end solutions. Each project follows the typical **Data Science pipeline**:

1. **Data Collection**: Gathering and preprocessing data.
2. **Data Analysis & Exploration**: Conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights.
3. **Model Building**: Implementing machine learning models for prediction or classification.
4. **Deployment**: Building an interactive dashboard or deploying models to production.

The four projects are:

1. **Project 1: Fair Allocation Algorithms** ⚙️
2. **Project 2: Short-distance carpooling solution** 🧑‍🤝‍🧑
3. **Project 3: Cardiac disease detection** 📅
4. **Project 4: Radiological image classification** 📢

## 🎓 Final Master Thesis (TFM)

The **TFM** is the culmination of my studies. It represents a comprehensive analysis and solution to a real-world problem. In this section, you'll find:

- The **code** that powers the analysis.
- **Data processing** steps and techniques.
- **Machine learning models** that were trained to make predictions or classifications.
- Detailed **documentation** explaining the methodology and results.

The problem I tackled for my thesis was **[leverage cutting-edge machine learning technology to identify and prevent pollution leaks from our machinery, ensuring a cleaner and safer environment for all]**.
